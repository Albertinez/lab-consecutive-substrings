Solution Description:
This solution generates all consecutive substrings of a given string using nested loops.
- The outer loop selects the starting index of the substring.
- The inner loop selects the ending index and slices the string.
- Each substring is collected in an array and returned.

Time Complexity:
O(n^2) because the number of substrings grows quadratically with the length of the input string.

Space Complexity:
O(n^2) because all substrings are stored in an array.
