SOLUTION DESCRIPTION:
This solution uses a nested loop approach to generate all consecutive substrings.

HOW IT WORKS:
1. We iterate through each possible starting position in the string (outer loop)
2. For each starting position, we iterate through all possible ending positions (inner loop)
3. We extract the substring from the start to end position using slice()
4. We add each substring to our result array
5. The substrings are naturally ordered as they appear in the original string

ALGORITHM TYPE:
Brute force approach with nested iteration

TIME COMPLEXITY: O(n²)
- The outer loop runs n times (where n is the string length)
- The inner loop runs approximately n times on average
- This gives us n * n = n² operations
- Note: If we count the substring extraction operation, it could be O(n³), 
  but the dominant factor is the nested loop structure at O(n²)

SPACE COMPLEXITY: O(n²)
- We store all substrings in the result array
- For a string of length n, there are n(n+1)/2 substrings
- This simplifies to O(n²) space
